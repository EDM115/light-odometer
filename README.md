# light-odometer ![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/light-odometer)

This project is made only for personal use, as a small and lightweight build of [tm-odometer](https://github.com/mtmarco87/tm-odometer), which is itself a fork of [HubSpot's odometer](https://github.com/HubSpot/odometer).  
Do not use this, use [@mtmarco87](https://github.com/mtmarco87)'s package instead.  
Huge props to him for this TypeScript refactor !
